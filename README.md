# Demo Nexter Website Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following a course on CSS and SASS ( [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) ).
\
\
The website is that of a fictitional company named Nexter which sells properties.
\
\
To make this miniproject a bit more intresting and enjoyable for me to work on I decide to implement it using VueJs instead of simply static HTML/CSS/SASS.

I am not too sure but I am not planning to go overboard with the Vue aspects but more on the CSS/SASS aspects presented in the course for this project (as the improvement in those areas is the main focus of this miniproject).
\
So basically all of the UI designs and HTML/CSS/SASS are taken from the course and not designed by me.
\
That being said I tend not to follow such projects very stricly but make adjustments and/or changes based on personal preferences where I find appropriate, so my project is most likely going to slightly diverge from the one coded by the instuctor in the course.
